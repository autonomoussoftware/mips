# Metronome Improvement Proposals (MIPS)

## Summary

This is a repository for Metronome Improvement Proposals (MIPS).   Proposals are modeled after the format of IETF documents, as is commonly seen in Bitcoin with https://github.com/bitcoin/bips and in Ethereum with https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs

## Creating Proposals

Anyone may create a proposal.  The minimum requirements are simply around editing - the format must look like EIPs - and applicability to Metronome and applications and formats surrounding Metronome.
